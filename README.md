This project explores a pizza sales dataset to derive key business insights through structured SQL queries. It covers basic, intermediate, and advanced analyses, focusing on order volume, revenue generation, pizza preferences, and category-wise performance.

##  Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of tables such as:
- `orders`: order-level details including timestamps.
- `order_details`: information about each item in an order.
- `pizzas`: details on pizza types, sizes, and prices.
- `pizza_types`: pizza categories and ingredients.

##  Project Overview
The Pizza Sales Analysis project focuses on extracting actionable insights from a fictional pizza shop's sales database. The goal is to understand customer behavior, revenue patterns, product performance, and sales trends by performing structured SQL queries.

By breaking the analysis into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels, the project builds a comprehensive view of pizza sales dynamics that can inform marketing, inventory, and operational strategies.

##  Workflow
1. **Data Understanding**
   - Review schema and relationships between tables.
   - Identify key fields: timestamps, prices, sizes, categories, and quantities.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Load tables into a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
   - Check for duplicates, nulls, and foreign key relationships.

3. **Basic SQL Analysis**
   - Total orders, total revenue, top-selling pizzas and sizes.
   - Use `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `MAX()`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`.

4. **Intermediate SQL Analysis**
   - Perform table joins for enriched analysis.
   - Analyze order times, pizza categories, and daily averages.

5. **Advanced SQL Analysis**
   - Revenue contribution %, cumulative revenue.
   - Use `RANK()`, window functions, percentage calculations.
