üçï PIZZA SALES ANALYSIS USING SQL
==================================

This project explores a pizza sales dataset to derive key business insights through structured SQL queries. It covers basic, intermediate, and advanced analyses, focusing on order volume, revenue generation, pizza preferences, and category-wise performance.

üìÅ Dataset Overview
-------------------
The dataset consists of tables such as:
- orders: order-level details including timestamps.
- order_details: information about each item in an order.
- pizzas: details on pizza types, sizes, and prices.
- pizza_types: pizza categories and ingredients.

üìå Project Overview
-------------------
The Pizza Sales Analysis project focuses on extracting actionable insights from a fictional pizza shop's sales database. The goal is to understand customer behavior, revenue patterns, product performance, and sales trends by performing structured SQL queries.

This analysis helps answer business-critical questions such as:
- What are the best-selling pizzas?
- When do most customers place orders?
- Which pizza sizes and categories generate the most revenue?
- How is revenue growing over time?

By breaking the analysis into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels, the project builds a comprehensive view of pizza sales dynamics that can inform marketing, inventory, and operational strategies.

üîÑ Workflow
-----------
1. Data Understanding
   - Review schema and relationships between tables.
   - Identify key fields: timestamps, prices, sizes, categories, and quantities.

2. Data Preparation
   - Load tables into a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
   - Check for duplicates, nulls, and foreign key relationships.

3. Basic SQL Analysis
   - Total orders, total revenue, top-selling pizzas and sizes.
   - Use COUNT(), SUM(), MAX(), GROUP BY, ORDER BY.

4. Intermediate SQL Analysis
   - Perform table joins for enriched analysis.
   - Analyze order times, pizza categories, and daily averages.

5. Advanced SQL Analysis
   - Revenue contribution %, cumulative revenue.
   - Use RANK(), window functions, percentage calculations.

6. Insight Generation
   - Interpret query results to derive business insights.
   - Visualize with Power BI/Excel (optional).

7. Documentation & Sharing
   - Summarize all findings in this README.
   - Publish project on GitHub.
